%% Bayesian Overview: 
% The likelihoods at each trial are analyzed together with the prior 
% probabilities (using Bayesâ€™ rule) to estimate the posterior probability 
% that the current choice is consistent with each hypothetical response 
% pattern using the equation: 
%Posterior(x) = likelihood(x) * prior(x)

% X         = each hypothetical pattern of behavior
%prior      = prior probability for the specific pattern
%likelihood = strength of evidence (how likely is the behavior you observed
%               under the hypothesized strategy)
%posterior  = how likely is the hypotheized strategy, given the evidence
%               from the current trial
%posterior probabilities are normalized so all posteriors sum to 1 and are
%used as priors for the following trial

%Intialization: at the beginning of each phase, priors and likelihoods are
%reset to a "hypothesis-neutral" value where each strategy is equal
%% Initial data import

    Subjects{XX} = temp;%this will work to run through a single cohort's data. How can I change this so it accepts the file names directly from the files variable?

%Should add save function so that after initial importing, I can directly

%getBayes function handles data pre-processing (specific for our data input
%structure). 
%Each cell contains a single session's data arranged in columns: phase -
%side selected - dimension 1 selected - dimension 2 selected
%Each row is 1 trial

%input to getBayes: full data file for a single subject (x)
%output from getBayes are formatted single sessions (output) as well as the length
%in number of trials of each session (sz)

%getSigm produces simgoidal likelihood values
%anaBayes calculates Bayesian posteriors (b-value) - this is the
%"probability" that an animal is following a given strategy
%posteriors are reset to 0.5 at the beginning of each phase
%(hypothesis-neutral) and accumulation above 0.6 (adjustable) indicates
%presence of strategy

%inputs to getSigm: subject number (XZ), each session for each subject (outpt), and
%session length (sz)
%outputs from  are session length (could probably replace with sz),
%likelihood values for each trial for spatial (SPlike), shape (SHlike), and
%color (COlike), and the trial number where each phase starts (Phases)

%inputs to anaBayes: all of the above (likelihood, phases, and total
%session length
%outputs from anaBayes: normalized posteriors, or b-values, for spatial
%(normSP), shape (normSH), and color (normCO) strategies'
